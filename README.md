Diabete Feature Engineering

Problem : You are asked to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

The dataset is part of a large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA.

It is the data used for a diabetes study of Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older living in the city of Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona in the USA. It consists of 768 observations and 8 numeric independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative result.

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies

Glucose: Glucose

BloodPressure: Blood Pressure (Diastolic)

SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
